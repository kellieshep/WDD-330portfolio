    <h1>CSS3 Transforms and Transitions</h1>
    <p>The CSS3 transform property lets you lets you translate, rotate, scale, and/or skew any element on the page. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Translate</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Transforms don’t work on inline elements. But that’s easy enough to fix. We’ll just add display: inline-block; to the element.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Rotate</li>
        <ul><li>If you only want to move an element vertically or horizontally, you can use the translatex or translatey functions respectively.</li></ul>
        <li>Scale</li>
        <ul><li>The scale(x,y) function scales an element by the defined factors horizontally then vertically. If only one value is provided, it will be used for both the x and y values, growing or shrinking your element or pseudo-element while maintaining the original aspect ratio. For example, scale(1) would leave the element the same size, scale(2) would double its proportions, scale(0.5) would halve them, and so on. </li></ul>
        <li>Skew</li>
        <ul><li>The skew(x,y) function specifies a skew along the x and y axes. As you’d expect, the x specifies the skew on the x axis, and the y specifies the skew on the y axis. If the second parameter is omitted, the skew will only occur on the x axis:</li></ul>
        <li>Changing the origin of the Transform</li>
        <ul><li> This is done using the transform-origin property. It has the same syntax as the background-position property, and defaults to the center of the object (so that scales and rotations will be around the center of the box by default).</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <h2>Transitions</h2>
    <p>Animation has certainly been possible for some time with JavaScript, but native CSS transitions generally require less client-side processing, so they’ll usually appear smoother. On mobile devices with limited computing power, this can be a lifesaver.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Declare the original state of the element in the default style declaration.</li>

    <li> Declare the final state of your transitioned element; for example, a :hover state.</li>

     <li>   Include the transition functions in your default style declaration using the transition properties, including: transition-property , transition-duration , transition-timing-function , and transition-delay . We’ll look at each of these and how they work shortly.</li>
</ol>
    <ul><li>transition-property</li>
    <li>transition-duration</li>
        <li>transition-timing-function</li>
        <ul><li>The most common timing functions include the key terms ease , linear , ease-in , ease-out , or ease-in-out .</li>
        <li>You can also describe your timing function more precisely by defining your own cubic-bezier function. It accepts four numeric parameters; for example, linear is the same as cubic-bezier(0, 0, 1, 1) .</li>
        <li> by using the transition-delay property, it’s possible to introduce a delay before the transition begins. Normally a transition begins immediately, so the default is 0 . Include the number of milliseconds ( ms ) or seconds ( s ) to delay the transition.</li>
        </ul>

    </ul>
<p>The transition properties allow for multiple transitions in one call. For example, if we want to change the color at the same time as changing the rotation and size, we can.</p>
<p>Transitions animate elements over time; however, they’re limited in what they can do. You can define starting and ending states, but there’s no fine-grained control over any intermediate states.CSS animations, unlike transitions, allow you to control each step of an animation via keyframes.
    A keyframe is a snapshot that defines a starting or end point of any smooth transition. With CSS transitions, we’re essentially limited to defining a first and a last keyframe. CSS animations allow us to add any number of keyframes in between, to guide our animation in more complex ways.</p>
<h3>Animation Properties</h3>
    <ul><li>animation-name:</li>
        <li>animation-duration:</li>
        <li>animation-timing-function:</li>
        <li>animation-iteration-count:</li>
        <li>animation-delay:</li>
        <li>animation-fill-mode:</li>
        <li>animation-play-state:</li>
        <li>.concise {
            animation: 300ms ease-in alternate 5s backwards appearDisappear;
            }</li>
    </ul>
<p>If using the shorthand property, be careful with your animation-name . You want to avoid accidentally using any animation property key term such as forwards , running , or alternate . Those three key terms in particular have caused many developers hours of debugging. If you include a key term, the browser will assume that the first occurrence of a valid value for any of the longhand properties is the value for that property, not the value for the animation-name property.</p>

<h1>Canvas, SVG, and Drag and Drop</h1>
    <h3>Creating a canvas element</h3>
    <p>The first step to using canvas is to add a <em>canvas</em> element to the page.You may be asking yourself, why not set the width and height via CSS? It’s because the width and height attributes determine how large the canvas’s coordinate system is. If we don’t specify width and height , the canvas element will default to a width of 300 and a height of 150. If we set the width and height for a canvas only in CSS, the canvas element will be 300 by 150, and the CSS properties will simply determine how large the box is that displays the image.</p>
    <canvas>
        Sorry! Your browser doesn’t support Canvas.
    </canvas>

    <img style="-webkit-user-select:  none;max-width: 100%;margin: auto;" src="images/guided.png" width="200px">
<p>As you may have gathered, the coordinate system in the canvas element is different from the Cartesian coordinate system you learned in math class. In the canvas coordinate system, the top-left corner is (0,0). If the canvas is 200 pixels by 200 pixels, then the bottom-right corner is (200,200), </p>
<h3>SVGS</h3>
    <p> SVG stands forScalable Vector Graphics, a specific file format that allows you to describe vector graphics using XML. A major selling point of vector graphics in general is that, unlike bitmap images (such as GIF, JPEG, PNG, and TIFF), vector images preserve their quality even as you blow them up or shrink them down. We can use SVG to do many of the same tasks we can do with canvas, including drawing paths, shapes, text, gradients, and patterns. </p>

    <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100">
        <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="25" fill="red"/>
    </svg>

<h3>Drag and Drop</h3>
    <p>There are several steps to adding drag and drop to your page:
        <ol>

    <li>Set the draggable attribute on any HTML elements you’d like to be draggable.</li>

    <li>Add an event listener for the dragstart event on any draggable HTML elements.</li>

    <li>Add an event listener for the dragover and drop events on any elements that you want to have accept dropped items.</li></ol></p>

<p>Important: draggable is not Boolean!<br>
    Note that draggable is not a Boolean attribute, so you have to explicitly set it to true </p>

            <h3>The DataTransfer Object</h3>
        <p>DataTransfer objects are one type of object outlined in the Drag and Drop API. These objects allow us to set and get data about the elements that are being dragged. Specifically, DataTransfer lets us define two pieces of information:
<ul>
           <li> the type of data we’re saving of the draggable element</li>

    <li>the value of the data itself</li></ul></p>
