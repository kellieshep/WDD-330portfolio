<h2>The Window Object</h2>
    <h3>The browser Object Model</h3>
<p>The Browser Object Model (or BOM for short) is a collection of properties and methods that contain information about the browser and computer screen. For example, we can find out which browser is being used to view a page (though, this method is unreliable). We can also find out the dimensions of the screen it is viewed on, and which pages have been visited before the current page. It can also be used for the rather dubious practice of creating pop-up windows, if you’re into annoying your users.<br>

    There is no official standard for the BOM, although there are a number of properties and methods that are supported by all the major browsers, making a sort of de facto standard. These properties and methods are made available through the window object. Every browser window, tab, popup, frame, and iframe has a window object.</p>
<h3>Going Global</h3>
    <p>Global variables are actual properties of a global object. In a browser environment, the global object is the window object. This means that any global variable created is actually a property of the window object</p>
<p>In general, you should refer to global variables without using the window object; it’s less typing and your code will be more portable between environments. An exception is if you need to check whether a global variable has been defined. </p>
<h3>Dialogs</h3>
 <p>The window.alert() method will pause the execution of the program and display a message in a dialog box. The message is provided as an argument to the method, and undefined is always returned:</p>
<p>The window.confirm() method will stop the execution of the program and display a confirmation dialog that shows the message provided as an argument, and giving the options of OK or Cancel. It returns the boolean values of true if the user clicks OK, and false if the user clicks Cancel:</p>
<p>The window.prompt() method will stop the execution of the program. It displays a dialog that shows a message provided as an argument, as well as an input field that allows the user to enter text. This text is then returned as a string when the user clicks OK. If the user clicks Cancel, null is returned:</p>
    <p>It’s worth reiterating again that these methods will stop the execution of a program in its tracks. This means that everything will stop processing at the point the method is called, until the user clicksOKorCancel. This can cause problems if the program needs to process something else at the same time or the program is waiting for a callback function.</p>

    <p> There are some occasions when this functionality can be used as an advantage, for example, a window.confirm() dialog can be used as a final check to see if a user wants to delete a resource. This will stop the program from going ahead and deleting the resource while the user decides what to do.</p>

   <p> It’s also worth keeping in mind that most browsers allow users to disable any dialogs from repeatedly appearing, meaning they are not a feature to be relied upon.</p>
<h4>Which Browser</h4>
<p>The window object has a navigator property that returns a reference to the Navigator object. The Navigator object contains information about the browser being used. Its userAgent property will return information about the browser and operating system being used. For example, if I run the following line of code, it shows that I am using Safari version 10 on Mac OS:</p>
<p>Don’t rely on this information though, as it can be modified by a user to masquerade as a different browser. It can also be difficult to make any sense of the string returned, because all browsers pretend to be others to some degree. For example, every browser will include the string “Mozilla” in its userAgent property, for reasons of legacy Netscape compatibility. The userAgent property has been deprecated from the official specification, but it remains well supported in all major browsers.</p>

<h3>Location Property</h3>
<p>The window.location property is an object that contains information about the URL of the current page. It contains a number of properties that provide information about different fragments of the URL.</p>
    <p>The href property returns the full URL as a string:</p>

    <p> window.location.href</p>
    <p> << "https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/javascript-novice-to-ninja"</p>
       <p> This property (as well as most of the others in this section) is a read/write property, which means it can also be changed by assignment. If this is done, the page will be reloaded using the new property. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>protocol-returns:http,https,pop2,ftp</li>
    <li>host-returns- www.sitepoint.com</li>
    <li>hostname-returns-www.sitepoint.com</li>
    <li>port</li>
        <li>pathname-returns-path</li>
        <li>search-The search property returns a string that starts with a “?” followed by the query string parameters. It returns an empty string if there are no query string parameters. </li>
   <li>hash-returns-The hash property returns a string that starts with a “#” followed by the fragment identifier. It returns an empty string if there is no fragment identifier:</li>
<li>origin-The origin property returns a string that shows the protocol and domain where the current page originated from. This property is read-only, so cannot be changed:</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The window.location object also has these methods.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The reload() method can be used to force a reload of the current page. If it’s given a parameter of true , it will force the browser to reload the page from the server, instead of using a cached page.</li>
    <li>The assign() method can be used to load another resource from a URL provided as a parameter, for example:

        window.location.assign('https://www.sitepoint.com/')</li>
<li>The replace() method is almost the same as the assign() method, except the current page will not be stored in the session history, so the user will be unable to navigate back to it using the back button.</li>
<li>The toString() method returns a string containing the whole URL:

    window.location.toString();
    << "https://www.sitepoint.com/javascript/"</li>
</ul>
    <p>The window.history object keeps information about the pages that have been visited in the session.</p>

    <p> You can open, close, resize, and move windows (although, this doesn’t mean you should!).</p>

    <p>The window.screen object provides information about the user’s screen.</p>

    <p>document.write() is an archaic method of writing text to the document and should be avoided.</p>

    <p>Cookies can be used to store small pieces of information between requests using the document.cookie property.</p>

    <p>The window.setTimeout() method can be used to invoke a function after a set amount of time. It can be canceled using the clearTimeout() method.</p>

    <p> The window.setInterval() method can be used to repeatedly invoke a function. It can be stopped using the clearInterval() method.</p>

    <p>The window.requestAnimationFrame() method can be used to produce smooth and optimized animation by utilizing the browser's built-in graphics capabilities. It can be canceled using the cancelAnimationFrame() method.</p>

<h2>HTML5 API's</h2>
    <h3>The data- Attribute</h3>
    <p>The data- attribute is a way of embedding data in a web page using custom attributes that are ignored by the browser. They’re also private to a page, so are not intended to be used by an external service – their sole purpose is to be used by a JavaScript program. This means they’re perfect for adding data that can be used as a hook that the program utilizes to access information about a particular element on the page.

        The names of these attributes can be decided by the developer, but they must use the following format:
<ul>
       <li> Start with data- .</li>

        <li>Contain only lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens, dots, colons or underscores.</li>

        <li>Include an optional string value.</li></ul></p>
    <h3>HTML5 Web Storage</h3>
    <p>The Web Storage API provides a key-value store on the client’s computer that is similar to using cookies but has fewer restrictions, more storage capacity, and is generally easier to use. This makes it perfect for storing information about users, as well as storing application-specific information that can then be used during future sessions.</p>
    <p>The Web Storage API has some crucial differences with cookies:</p>
    <ul><li>Information stored isnotshared with the server on every request.</li>

    <li> Information is available in multiple windows of the browser (but only if the domain is the same).</li>

    <li>Storage capacity limit is much larger than the 4KB limit for cookies ( There is no actual limit in the specification, but most browsers have a limit set at 5GB per domain.).</li>

    <li>Any data stored does not automatically expire as it does with cookies. This potentially makes cookies a better choice for something like showing a popup once a day.</li></ul>
<p>localStorage.setItem('name', 'Walter White')</p>
<p>localStorage.getItem('name');<br>
    << "Walter White"</p>

<p>Rather than using the getItem() and setItem() methods, assignment can be used instead. In the next example, we simply reference localStorage.name as if it was a variable to change its value:
<br>
    localStorage.name = 'Heisenberg';<br>
    console.log(localStorage.name);<br>
    << "Heisenberg";<br>
    To remove an entry from local storage, use the removeItem method:
    <br>
    localStorage.removeItem('name');<br>
    Alternatively, this can be done using the delete operator:
    <br>
    delete localStorage.name;<br>
    To completely remove everything stored in local storage, use the clear() method:
    <br>
    localStorage.clear();</p>
    <li><li>key tells us the key of the item that changed</li>

       <li> newValue tells us the new value to which it has been changed</li>

        <li>oldValue tells us the previous value before it was changed</li>

       <li> storageArea tells us if it is stored in local or session storage.</li></ul>

<h3>Geolocation</h3>
    <p>The Geolocation API is used to obtain the geographical position of the device. This means it can be used to find the user’s exact location, then link to nearby places or measure the speed at which the user is moving. This information can then be used to filter data based on the user's location or speed and direction of travel. An example of this might be a search function that returns results based on your location. Because of privacy concerns, permission to use this has to be granted by the user first.

       <br> If geolocation is available, it will be a property of the navigator object that we met in Chapter 9. This property has a method called getCurrentPosition() that will return a position object to a specified callback function</p>
<p>The position object has several other properties that can be used to find out information about the location and movement of the device:
<ul><li>
    position.speed property returns the ground speed of the device in meters per second.</li>

    <li> position.altitude property returns an estimate of the device’s altitude in meters above theWGS84ellipsoid, which is a standard measurement for the center of the Earth.</li>

      <li> position.heading property returns the direction the device is moving in. This is measured as a bearing in degrees, clockwise from North.</li>

    <li> position.timestamp property returns the time that the position information was recorded.</li></ul></p>
